    /*
    The first class that we will discuss is one of the most commonly used in the java.io API, the java.io.File class, or File class for short.
    The File class is used to
            read information about existing files and directories,
            list the contents of a directory, and
            create/delete files and directories.
    An instance of a File class represents the pathname of a particular file or directory on the file system.
    The File class cannot read or write data within a file, although it can be passed as a reference to many stream classes to read or write data, as you shall see in the next section.

    /**
     * One common mistake new Java developers make is forgetting that the File class can be used to represent directories as well as files.
